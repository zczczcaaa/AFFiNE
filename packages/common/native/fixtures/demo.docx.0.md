# DOCX Demo

# <a name="OLE_LINK1"></a><a name="OLE_LINK2"></a><a name="_Toc359077851"></a>Demonstration of DOCX support in calibre

This document demonstrates the ability of the calibre DOCX Input plugin to convert the various typographic features in a Microsoft Word (2007 and newer) document. Convert this document to a modern ebook format, such as AZW3 for Kindles or EPUB for other ebook readers, to see it in action.

There is support for images, tables, lists, footnotes, endnotes, links, dropcaps and various types of text and paragraph level formatting.

To see the DOCX conversion in action, simply add this file to calibre using the **“Add Books” **button and then click “**Convert”. ** Set the output format in the top right corner of the conversion dialog to EPUB or AZW3 and click **“OK”**.

## <a name="_Toc359077853"></a>Inline formatting

Here, we demonstrate various types of inline text formatting and the use of embedded fonts.

Here is some **bold, ***italic, ****bold-italic, ***__underlined __and ~~struck out ~~ text. Then, we have a superscript and a subscript. Now we see some red, green and blue text. Some text with a yellow highlight. Some text in a box. Some text in inverse video.

A paragraph with styled text: subtle emphasis  followed by strong text and intense emphasis. This paragraph uses document wide styles for styling rather than inline text properties as demonstrated in the previous paragraph — calibre can handle both with equal ease.

## <a name="_Toc359077854"></a>Fun with fonts

This document has embedded the Ubuntu font family. The body text is in the Ubuntu typeface, here is some text in the Ubuntu Mono typeface, notice how every letter has the same width, even i and m. Every embedded font will automatically be embedded in the output ebook during conversion.

You can do crazy things with paragraphs, if the urge strikes you. For instance this paragraph is right aligned and has a right border. It has also been given a light gray background.
