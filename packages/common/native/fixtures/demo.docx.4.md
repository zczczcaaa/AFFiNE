Miscellaneous structural elements you can add to your document, like footnotes, endnotes, dropcaps and the like. 

## <a name="_Toc359077858"></a>Footnotes & Endnotes

Footnotes and endnotes are automatically recognized and both are converted to endnotes, with backlinks for maximum ease of use in ebook devices.

## <a name="_Toc359077859"></a>Dropcaps

D

rop caps are used to emphasize the leading paragraph at the start of a section. In Word it is possible to specify how many lines of text a drop-cap should use. Because of limitations in ebook technology, this is not possible when converting.  Instead, the converted drop cap will use font size and line height to simulate the effect as well as possible. While not as good as the original, the result is usually tolerable. This paragraph has a “D” dropcap set to occupy three lines of text with a font size of 58.5 pts. Depending on the screen width and capabilities of the device you view the book on, this dropcap can look anything from perfect to ugly.

## <a name="_Toc359077860"></a>Links

Two kinds of links are possible, those that refer to an external website and those that refer to locations inside the document itself. Both are supported by calibre. For example, here is a link pointing to the [calibre download page](http://calibre-ebook.com/download). Then we have a link that points back to the section on [paragraph level formatting](#_Paragraph_level_formatting) in this document.

## <a name="_Toc359077861"></a>Table of Contents

There are two approaches that calibre takes when generating a Table of Contents. The first is if the Word document has a Table of Contents itself. Provided that the Table of Contents uses hyperlinks, calibre will automatically use it. The levels of the Table of Contents are identified by their left indent, so if you want the ebook to have a multi-level Table of Contents, make sure you create a properly indented Table of Contents in Word.
