For the lovers of poetry amongst you, paragraphs with hanging indents, like this often come in handy. You can use hanging indents to ensure that a line of poetry retains its individual identity as a line even when the screen is  too narrow to display it as a single line. Not only does this paragraph have a hanging indent, it is also has an extra top margin, setting it apart from the preceding paragraph.

Tables in Word can vary from the extremely simple to the extremely complex. calibre tries to do its best when converting tables. While you may run into trouble with the occasional table, the vast majority of common cases should be converted very well, as demonstrated in this section. Note that for optimum results, when creating tables in Word, you should set their widths using percentages, rather than absolute units.  To the left of this paragraph is a floating two column table with a nice green border and header row.

Now let’s look at a fancier table—one with alternating row colors and partial borders. This table is stretched out to take 100% of the available width.

|              |         |         |         |         |         |
| ------------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| City or Town | Point A | Point B | Point C | Point D | Point E |
| Point A      | —     |         |         |         |         |
| Point B      | 87      | —     |         |         |         |
| Point C      | 64      | 56      | —     |         |         |
| Point D      | 37      | 32      | 91      | —     |         |
| Point E      | 93      | 35      | 54      | 43      | —     |

Next, we see a table with special formatting in various locations. Notice how the formatting for the header row and sub header rows is preserved.
